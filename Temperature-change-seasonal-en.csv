"Note: Seasonal average temperature departures were computed for weather stations across Canada with sufficiently long data records to allow for trend calculation and were then interpolated to a 50-kilometre spaced grid. Seasonal grid point values were averaged together to produce a seasonal time series of temperature departures representing the entire country. Seasons are defined as winter (December, January, and February), spring (March, April, and May), summer (June, July, and August) and fall (September, October, and November).Departures are calculated by subtracting the 1961 to 1990 reference value from the seasonal average.
